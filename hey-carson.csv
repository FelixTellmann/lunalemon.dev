This action might be an announcement or sale you want to the visitor to know about, but more often than not, it's to collect email addresses. Test after test has proven that popups work extremely well. In&nbsp;one test, popups drove 1,375% more email captures vs. a sidebar opt-in form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can implement different types of popups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timed-Based&nbsp;- This method will show your popup after a predetermined amount of time. A time-based popup can work well if you set it to 60 seconds or greater, as you know at that point you are showing it to someone that's been engaged with your site for a while and more committed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Content-Based&nbsp;- Content-based popup will only show your popup on specified pages.</li>
<li>Scroll-Based&nbsp;- A scroll-based popup will show your popup when a user has scrolled a specific percentage of the way down your page. This is commonly used on blog posts and is similar to the timed method as you are only showing your popup to someone who has engaged with your page a specific amount.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Exit-Intent&nbsp;- An exit-intent popup only shows when a visitor is about to leave your site. Using cursor tracking, the popup app will determine when someone is about to click the back or close button on their browser and show your popup in a last-ditch</li>
